         What is an Error in Java?
         --------------------------
         An error is a serious issue that occurs during program execution or compilation,
         which prevents the program from running correctly.

         Types of Errors
         ----------------
         1. Compile-Time Errors: Happen when the code doesn’t follow Java syntax rules.
            Example: Missing semicolons, undefined variables.

         2. Runtime Errors: Happen while the program is running due to invalid operations.
            Example: Dividing by zero, accessing null objects.

         3. Logical Errors: The program runs but produces incorrect results due to flaws in logic.
            Example: Using the wrong formula for calculations.

         Examples of Common Errors
         --------------------------
         1. NullPointerException: Using an object that hasn’t been initialized.
         2. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Trying to access an array element outside its size.
         3. ClassNotFoundException: Referencing a class that doesn’t exist.

         Difference Between Errors and Exceptions
         -----------------------------------------
         1. Errors: Represent serious problems that are usually not recoverable (e.g., OutOfMemoryError).
         2. Exceptions: Indicate issues in the program that can often be fixed or handled (e.g., IOException).

         How to Handle Errors
         ---------------------
         1. Use try-catch blocks for recoverable issues (exceptions).
         2. Fix the code for compile-time and logical errors.
