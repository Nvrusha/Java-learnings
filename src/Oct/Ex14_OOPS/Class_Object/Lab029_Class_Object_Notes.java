        //Class

        //1.Definition: A blueprint for creating objects, containing fields (attributes) and methods
        //(behaviors).

        //2.Syntax: Defined using the class keyword (e.g., class Car { ... }).

        //3.Components:
        //Fields: Variables that define the properties of the class.
        //Methods: Functions that define the behaviors of the class.
        //Constructors: Initialize new objects of the class.

        //4.Access Modifiers: Can be public, default, protected, or private (within nested classes).

        //5.Static Members: Belong to the class rather than any instance; shared by all objects.

        //Object

        //1.Definition: An instance of a class; created using the new keyword
        //(e.g., Car myCar = new Car();).

        //2.Attributes and Methods: Each object has its own set of attribute values (fields) and can
        //use the methods defined in its class.

        //3.State and Behavior:

        //State: Defined by values of fields (e.g., color, speed).
        //Behavior: Defined by methods (e.g., start, stop).

        //4.Heap Memory: Objects are stored in heap memory.

        //5.Reference Variable: Used to access an object; it holds the memory address of the object.


        //Important Points
        //1.Multiple Instances: A class can have multiple objects with different states.

        //2.Garbage Collection: Unused objects are automatically cleaned up by Java’s garbage collector.

        //3.Method Invocation: Accessed by objectName.methodName() to perform actions.

        //4.Null Reference: An object reference can be null, indicating it points to no object.

        //5.Together, classes and objects are fundamental to Java's object-oriented programming structure, encapsulating data and behavior within reusable templates.
